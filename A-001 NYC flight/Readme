# NYC_FLIGHT_EDA

Exploratory Data analysis of New York Flight data.

The aim is to get strong insights which can lead to improve the performance of NYC flights

the csv file has only 200 data points(due to 25MB limit in Github)

the analysis went through the following way:

Grouped data based on Carrier name
departure and arrival delays are crossed checked
NA values in above are found using the equation : speed = distance/time
and filled the values per carrier

after filling the NA values removed the ouliers using dropna() function.

then analysed the monthly carrier characteristics, departure and arrival delay
and I could find that most of the flights departure before time

and the some of the flights had a delay of 12 hours which is a very bad.

I could find the months which have good carrier delay and best performers

Moreover, better insights could be drawn from the data. I believe these insight could make more millions in the industry.

Thank you for your time
