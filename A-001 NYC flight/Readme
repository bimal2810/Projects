# Exploratory Data analysis of New York Flight data.

The analysis went through the following way:

- Grouped data based on Carrier name
- Departure and arrival delays are crossed checked
- NA values in above are found using the equation :

					*### speed = distance/time *
					
and filled the values per carrier

- Removed the ouliers using dropna() function.

### #### *Findings from data *

 - #####  Top 10 destinations from NYC

![Top 10 destinations](https://github.com/bimal2810/Projects/blob/588db436ee97a308f12a48a86671eb0bd06bb643/A-001%20NYC%20flight/images/2.PNG?raw=true "Top 10 destinations")

- ATL had 12.21% number of flights from NYC followed by ORD 12.02%.

- ##### Monthly Carrier Analysis

- The monthly carrier characteristics, departure and arrival delay, I could find that most of the flights departure before time and the some of the flights had a delay of 12 hours which is a very bad.

- ##### How much is the monthly delay

- ##### Speed V/S On-time arrival

- ##### Density of departure and arrival delay

- ##### Conclusion

- I believe these insight could make more millions in the industry

- Extreme delays occur in the months of June,  July and December

-  Most of the flights leave early i.e. 55% which need to be controlled

-  Controlling early departure could help in reducing delay issues by  57%.

-  Delayed flights could not reach on time by increasing the speed.

-  EWR & JAC were the locations which need immediate attention.
